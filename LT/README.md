> Experience in teaching IPL (Information Processing Language)t
programming has shown that class discussion of a good model program is
an essential ingredient for comprehension of applications and
potentialities of the IPL concepts. This documentation of the "Logic
Theory Machine," otherwise known as LT, is specifically aimed at
filling the need for such a program.

> LT was the best candidate for
development as a pedagogical model because 1) it is based in the
readily understood context of theorem proving in sentential calculus;
2) literature on theorem proving is readily available; and 3) the
original LT, written in an early version of IPL by Newell, Shaw, and
Simon, established the field of heuristic programming. Because it is a
valuable example for students to examine and modify, LT has survived
beyond its usefulness as a research tool.

## Code extraction

The code listing in the report on pages 140-195 has been extracted. It
is available in three formats:

- [LT.txt](./LT.txt) - original card image format
- [LT.liplv](./LT.liplv) - s-expressions, suitable for Jeff Shrager's IPL-V
  interpreter in Lisp at [jeffshrager/IPL-V/](https://github.com/jeffshrager/IPL-V/)
- [LT.tsv](./LT.tsv) - tab-separated columns for easier viewing in a spreadsheet
